# Testing Rules

- Use httptest.NewServer for fingerprinter/looter/poisoner tests
- DB-dependent tests gate with: if os.Getenv("AGENTHOUND_NEO4J_URI") == "" { t.Skip() }
- Use t.TempDir() for state directories; t.Setenv("AGENTHOUND_STATE_DIR", tmp) for receipt tests
- Use t.Setenv("HOME", tmp) to bypass AUTHORIZED sentinel prompts in CLI tests
- Sentinel files to pre-create: loot-acknowledged, poison-acknowledged, extract-acknowledged
- Fingerprinter tests: happy path + negative (wrong response shape) + network error (closed port)
- Module tests MUST NOT use rootCmd.Execute() due to cobra state pollution — call RunE directly
- Race detector: always run with -race flag locally and in CI
- Coverage floor: 55% for unit tests (-short), 60% for full suite (with DBs)
- Post-processors mutate the WHOLE graph (no scan_id scope), so DB-touching package test binaries cannot share one Neo4j concurrently under `go test ./...` (parallel binaries → EntityNotFound / phantom zero-counts). Each such package (analysis, analysis/processors, graph) MUST add a TestMain calling dbtest.Lock() (server/internal/dbtest) — an exclusive flock, no-op without AGENTHOUND_NEO4J_URI. Any NEW package running post-processors against a live DB needs the same TestMain guard.
