# Detection Rules

AgentHound detects security issues in AI agent infrastructure through graph analysis and pattern matching. All detections are mapped to [OWASP MCP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/) and [OWASP Agentic Security Initiative Top 10](https://genai.owasp.org/).

## Two layers of detection

AgentHound surfaces findings through two complementary layers:

| Layer | Where it runs | Count | Storage |
|---|---|---|---|
| **YAML rules engine** | Inside collectors at scan time. Drives capability classification, credential extraction, prompt-injection pattern matching, instruction-file poisoning, source-trust tagging, and resource-sensitivity classification. | **35 builtin rules** | `sdk/rules/builtin/*.yaml`. Inspect with `agenthound rules list`; test with `agenthound rules test`; query the running server via `GET /api/v1/rules`. |
| **Pre-built graph queries** | Inside `agenthound-server` against the post-processed Neo4j graph. Each query expresses a high-level finding as a Cypher path or pattern. | **19 queries** | `server/internal/analysis/prebuilt/`. Surface as findings via `GET /api/v1/analysis/findings`, runnable via `GET /api/v1/analysis/prebuilt/{id}` or `agenthound-server query --prebuilt <id>`. |

The two layers feed each other: the rules engine emits structured signals (`capability_surface`, `is_exposed`, `has_injection_patterns`, `source_trust`, sensitivity classifications) on collected nodes; the post-processors and pre-built queries consume those signals to compute composite edges (`HAS_ACCESS_TO`, `CAN_REACH`, `POISONED_DESCRIPTION`, `TAINTS`, `IFC_VIOLATION`, `CONFUSED_DEPUTY`, `POISONS_CONTEXT`, etc.) and enumerate attack paths.

The detections summarized below are the **pre-built-query** layer. The 35 underlying YAML rules are not enumerated here individually — read them directly in `sdk/rules/builtin/` for the canonical truth. Composite-edge detections (`TAINTS`, `IFC_VIOLATION`, `CONFUSED_DEPUTY`, `POISONS_CONTEXT`) surface through `GET /api/v1/analysis/findings` rather than a named pre-built query.

## Tool poisoning (MCP05)

**What:** MCP tool descriptions contain prompt injection patterns that manipulate agent behavior.

**How detected:** The MCP Collector scans tool descriptions for injection markers (imperative instructions, base64 blobs, hidden Unicode, references to ignoring safety instructions). Detected tools get a `POISONED_DESCRIPTION` self-edge.

**Risk:** A poisoned tool can cause an agent to execute unintended actions, leak data, or bypass safety controls when the agent reads the tool description during planning.

**Example finding:**
```
MCPTool:dangerous-tool has injection pattern: "ignore all previous instructions"
```

## Tool shadowing (MCP05)

**What:** A tool on one server mimics or references a tool on another server, potentially hijacking agent actions.

**How detected:** The SHADOWS post-processor compares tool descriptions across servers. When a tool on server B references server A's tool by name or has a suspiciously similar description, a `SHADOWS` edge is created.

**Risk:** An attacker controlling a low-trust server can shadow a legitimate tool. When an agent calls the shadowed tool, the malicious server handles the request instead.

## Tool name collision (MCP05, ASI03)

**What:** Tools on different servers share a normalized (trimmed, lower-cased) name.

**How detected:** The `tool-name-collision` pre-built query matches `MCPTool` nodes across distinct servers whose names collide after normalization, with distinct `objectid`s.

**Risk:** A malicious server can register a tool with the same name as a trusted one. Depending on resolution order, the agent may invoke the attacker's tool instead — a name-based variant of tool shadowing.

## Rug pull detection (MCP05, MCP09)

**What:** A tool's pinned surface changes between scans, potentially indicating a supply chain attack.

**How detected:** Each tool carries `description_hash` and `input_schema_hash`; each server carries `instructions_hash`. The node MERGE pivots `previous_*_hash` on every scan. The `rug-pull` pre-built query fires when any of the three current hashes differs from its previous value, and returns a `change_kind` discriminator (`description`, `input_schema`, `instructions`, or a comma-joined combination) identifying which surface drifted.

**Risk:** An attacker who gains control of an MCP server package can change tool descriptions, input schemas, or server instructions to include injection patterns after the initial trust decision was made. Schema and instruction pinning catch rug pulls that leave the description untouched.

## Unauthenticated servers (MCP03)

**What:** MCP servers with no authentication configured, meaning any client can connect and use all tools.

**How detected:** The Config Collector parses auth configuration for each server. Servers with `auth_method: none` or missing auth configuration are flagged via the `no-auth-servers` query.

**Risk:** No authentication means no access control. Any process on the same machine (stdio) or network (HTTP) can invoke all tools and access all resources.

## Instruction file poisoning (MCP05, ASI03)

**What:** Agent instruction files (`.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules`, `agents.md`, etc.) contain suspicious patterns.

**How detected:** The Config Collector scans instruction files for imperative overrides ("you must", "ignore previous"), exfiltration commands (curl/wget to external URLs), hidden Unicode (zero-width characters, RTL overrides), and encoded payloads. Flagged files get a `POISONED_INSTRUCTIONS` self-edge.

**Risk:** Poisoned instructions can override agent safety behavior, cause data exfiltration, or grant unauthorized access.

## Hardcoded secrets (MCP03, ASI04)

**What:** High-entropy strings in MCP server configuration that are likely hardcoded API keys or secrets.

**How detected:** The Config Collector measures Shannon entropy of credential values. Base64 strings with entropy > 4.5 and hex strings with entropy > 3.0 are flagged as `high_entropy`.

**Risk:** Secrets in config files end up in version control, backups, and logs. Rotation is difficult because the secret is embedded in client configurations across machines.

## Shell access paths (MCP01)

**What:** An agent can reach tools with shell execution or code execution capabilities.

**How detected:** The CAN_EXECUTE post-processor identifies tools with `shell_access` or `code_execution` in their `capability_surface`. The `agents-shell-access` query traces paths from agents through trust relationships to these tools.

**Risk:** Shell access from an agent means arbitrary command execution on the server host. Combined with no-auth or weak-auth servers, this is a critical RCE vector.

## Data exfiltration routes (MCP04, ASI08)

**What:** An agent can reach sensitive data (databases, credentials, files) AND has an outbound channel (network_outbound, email_send).

**How detected:** The CAN_EXFILTRATE_VIA post-processor combines CAN_REACH edges to sensitive resources with tools that have an outbound capability. The outbound capability set is `email_send`, `network_outbound`, `file_write`, plus two channel classes:

- **`auto_fetch_render`** — tools that return content the host may auto-fetch/render (markdown images, HTML previews). *Caveat:* this detects tools that **return** renderable content, not the host's render policy — host-side rendering behavior is not observable by the collector, so treat it as a candidate channel.
- **`allowlisted_proxy`** — tools that proxy requests through an allowlisted egress, which can slip exfiltration past naive egress controls.

**Risk:** This is the complete attack chain: access sensitive data, then send it somewhere. Two capabilities that are safe independently become critical when combined.

## Untrusted input sources & taint (MCP05, ASI03)

**What:** Tools that ingest attacker-controllable content (open web, inbound email, external file shares) and the downstream flow of that taint into other tools and sensitive sinks.

**How detected:** The `source-untrusted-web`, `source-untrusted-email`, and `source-untrusted-fileshare` rules tag matching tools with a `source_trust` property. The MCP Collector then emits an `INGESTS_UNTRUSTED` raw edge from each tagged tool to the resources on its server. Two post-processors consume that signal:

- **`TAINTS`** — links an untrusted-input tool to a tool on **another** server when they share ≥2 input-schema keys, modeling data flow between tools with compatible inputs.
- **`IFC_VIOLATION`** — links an untrusted source to a high-impact sink (`credential_access` / `file_write` / `email_send`) that shares a resource within 3 `HAS_ACCESS_TO` hops, an information-flow-control violation.

Keyword sets are kept deliberately narrow — universal taint destroys signal.

**Risk:** Untrusted content reaching a privileged tool is the core indirect-prompt-injection primitive: an attacker who controls a fetched web page or inbound email can drive a credential- or file-writing tool.

## Confused deputy (ASI06, MCP04)

**What:** A weakly-authenticated A2A agent can drive a strongly-authenticated one through delegation, borrowing its privileges.

**How detected:** The `auth_strength` pre-pass materializes a numeric weakness score onto every node with an `auth_method`. The `confused_deputy` post-processor emits a `CONFUSED_DEPUTY` edge for `DELEGATES_TO` pairs where the caller's `auth_strength` ≥ 80 (none/apiKey-class) and the callee's ≤ 30 (oauth/mtls-class).

**Risk:** The anonymous or low-trust caller effectively escalates to the callee's privilege level — a classic confused-deputy escalation across an agent trust boundary.

## Context poisoning (MCP05, ASI03)

**What:** An injection-bearing tool can poison the shared agent context that drives a high-capability tool, even without naming it.

**How detected:** The shadows processor emits a `POISONS_CONTEXT` edge from any tool with `has_injection_patterns=true` to tools carrying a high-blast capability (`shell_access`, `code_execution`, `credential_access`, `email_send`). Fan-out is capped at 20 sinks per source tool to prevent a cartesian blow-up; `scripts/perf-check.sh` enforces a ≤200 poisoned-pair-per-agent ceiling.

**Risk:** Unlike `SHADOWS` (which requires the poisoner to name its target), context poisoning models the broader case where injected text in one tool's description influences how the agent invokes a dangerous sibling tool.

## Cross-protocol attack paths (MCP01, ASI01)

**What:** An A2A agent can reach MCP resources by traversing the A2A-MCP protocol boundary.

**How detected:** The cross-protocol post-processor correlates A2A agents with MCP servers running on the same host. When an A2A agent delegates to another agent that shares a host with an MCP server, a cross-protocol `CAN_REACH` edge is created from the A2A agent to MCP resources.

**Risk:** Cross-protocol paths are invisible to single-protocol analysis tools. An attacker exploiting an A2A agent can pivot through host co-location to access MCP resources that were never explicitly trusted by any A2A agent.

## Credential chain paths (MCP03, ASI04)

**What:** Multi-hop paths from agents to resources that traverse credential boundaries.

**How detected:** The `credential-chain` pre-built query traces paths up to 6 hops that pass through Identity and Credential nodes, identifying where credential reuse or sharing creates transitive access.

**Risk:** Shared credentials between services create implicit trust relationships. Compromising one credential grants access to all services that share it.

## LiteLLM credential leak (MCP03, ASI04)

**What:** LiteLLM gateways that expose upstream provider credentials reachable from agent-discovered configuration secrets.

**How detected:** The `litellm-credential-leak` pre-built query joins LiteLLM `EXPOSES_CREDENTIAL` edges with credentials discovered elsewhere by matching `value_hash`.

**Risk:** A leaked LiteLLM master key can expose upstream provider credentials, expanding one config secret into access to multiple model providers.

## Unpinned packages (MCP09)

**What:** MCP servers using `npx -y @package` without a version pin.

**How detected:** The Config Collector parses server commands and flags `npx -y` without `@version` suffix on the package name.

**Risk:** Unpinned packages always fetch the latest version. A supply chain attack on the package registry replaces the server binary for all users.

## Unpinned + shell access (MCP01, MCP09)

**What:** The highest-risk supply chain scenario: an unpinned package that also has shell execution tools.

**How detected:** The `unpinned-shell` pre-built query combines unpinned package detection with shell access capability analysis.

**Risk:** A supply chain attacker gains not just tool manipulation but arbitrary code execution on the host through the shell access tools.

## Agent impersonation (ASI03)

**What:** A2A agents with highly similar skill descriptions, enabling one agent to impersonate another.

**How detected:** The CAN_IMPERSONATE post-processor computes TF-IDF cosine similarity on skill descriptions. Agent pairs with similarity > 0.8 get a `CAN_IMPERSONATE` edge.

**Risk:** In a multi-agent system, a malicious agent mimicking a trusted agent's skills can intercept task delegations.

## Chokepoint analysis (MCP01, ASI06)

**What:** Servers or tools that, if compromised, would impact a disproportionately large number of agents or resources.

**How detected:** The `chokepoint-servers` query finds MCP servers trusted by multiple agents. The `chokepoint-tools` query finds tools with access to many resources.

**Risk:** Chokepoints are high-value targets. Compromising one chokepoint server may grant access to every agent that trusts it.
