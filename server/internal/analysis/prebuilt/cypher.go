// All Cypher queries are Neo4j 4.4 compatible (no quantified paths, no pattern comprehensions).

// Critical Paths

// CypherLitellmCredentialLeak surfaces the full v0.2 credential-chain
// finding: an Agent instance whose Config Collector emission has the
// same value_hash as a LiteLLM master-key Credential, and that
// LiteLLM gateway exposes upstream provider keys. The
// cross_service_credential_chain post-processor pre-populates the
// agent → upstream-key CAN_REACH edge; this query joins the path
// for human-readable findings output.
