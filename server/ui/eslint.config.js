// Flat ESLint config for the AgentHound UI.
//
// Its single job in Phase 1 is to enforce the layered import-direction rule
// from ARCHITECTURE.md via eslint-plugin-boundaries. We deliberately do NOT
// enable a broad TypeScript/React ruleset here: the existing src/components
// tree predates this refactor and a recommended ruleset would flood `npm run
// lint` with pre-existing-style noise. tsc (`npm run build`) already covers
// type/unused-symbol checking. Code-quality rulesets can be layered on later.
//
// The four architectural layers (only these are "elements"):
//   app      -> may import features, entities, shared
//   features -> may import entities, shared, and ONLY their own feature
//   entities -> may import shared and sibling entities (shared wire types)
//   shared   -> may import shared only (no upward imports)
//
// Files that match none of the element patterns (e.g. the current
// src/components/*, src/api/*, src/hooks/* trees, or src/main.tsx) are
// treated as "unknown" and skipped by boundaries/dependencies, so this
// config reports zero violations on the pre-migration tree.
//
// NOTE: eslint-plugin-boundaries v6 renamed `element-types` -> `dependencies`
// and uses structured selectors ({ from, allow: { to } }) with Handlebars
// capture templates ({{ from.captured.feature }}).
